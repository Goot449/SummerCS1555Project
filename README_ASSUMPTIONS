Database TermProject Assumptions

Group: Nathan Spangler, Connor Kazmierczak, Jacob Guttenplan

1. person running this program first sourced bash.env on unix as well as ran
   our database.sql file prior to running the FaceSpaceApp program

2. a message can be sent without a senderID, for the sender could be spam

3. A message can be sent to a group by a non Member. "hey I would like to join"

4. Group Names are case sensitive

5. Methods check for user input errors but just return an error message.
    This is to ensure the driver doesn't get stuck in the method if an input is wrong.
